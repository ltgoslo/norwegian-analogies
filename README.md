# norwegian-analogies

This repository distributes the Norwegian Analogy Test Set, created through the translation and modification of the original 
Google Analogy Test Set developed by T. Mikolov, K. Chen, G. Corrado and J. Dean, [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf).

The Norwegian Analogy Test Set - ```norwegian-analogies.txt``` - is a list of 17,807 Norwegian analogy questions, divided into subsets of 8,944 semantic and 8,863 syntactic questions, such as ```gutt jente bror søster``` and ```dårlig dårligere stor større```.

The repository also holds a script - ```eval.py``` - for evaluating model performance in detecting analogies.
